## Game Elements: 
This FPS Game is based on a zombie apocalypse world where you are the only one alive and you must utilize all your resources and survive as long as possible!

Here are the elements present within this game: 
1. We have a hill-forest terrain with several man-made structures to which the player can explore.

2. The player has two weapons (can swap between thw two)
   - A rifle (main weapon)
   - A pistol (secondary weapon)

3. The player has the following stat values:
   - Health Bar (Red): Contains information of the player's health
   - Shields (Blue): Will take most damage from zombies rather than the health. If this runs out then player health damage will increase
   - Stamina (Green): Player's stamina for running (will recharge overtime and can timeout if reaches 0)
   - Points: These are the points accumulated throughout the game, killing zombies will gain the player points. 
 
4. The player also has the following perks available to which they can spend on with points to increase their abilities
   - Armour: Increases durability from zombie damage
   - Stamina: Decreases depletion of stamina (can run for longer)
   - Damage: Increases damage to zombies
   - Point Multipler: Increases the amount of points received per kill

5. The player's HUD featurses
   - The player's stat bars
   - The player's points achieved 
   - The player's perks
   - The player's ammunition remaining
   - The round/wave of zombies they are currently on
  
6. To enter man-made structures, players must find hidden gemstones which can unlock the doors which can reveal perks and more items

7. Around the map are Ammo Stations and Health Stations to which players can stock up on Ammo and Health Points.

8. Zombies will spawn in waves/rounds where the rounds get drastically more difficult with the zombie numbers and damage to the player increase.

9. When the player dies, they can choose to restart the game or return to the main menu. 

10. The game presents a main menu screen from which the user can read the instructions, start the game ot exit the game. 

11. If the player wishes to return to the main menu, the option to press 'P' at anytime is always available.

## Improvements: 
1. One improvement could be to display the statistics for each game at the end (game over screen) as well possibly saving these statistics in a highscore section of the main menu so players can always attempt to beat their last score. 

2. Another improvement could be to add health bars or particle effects to the zombies when they are shot as there is currently no indication of whether they are getting hit or not. 

3. Adding areas of the map such as lava or spikes which can significantly damage the player can add a great challenge.
